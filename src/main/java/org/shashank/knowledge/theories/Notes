Strings -
Are Anagrams -> create map & reduce map (Only solution)
All Uncommon words -> Use set to remove duplicates first
Matching chars -> simple char indexOf
Remove Duplicates - LinkedHashSet in O(n) or sort + compare for O(nlogn)

Misc -
RemoveDuplicatesSortedArray using O(1) auxillary space - start with i as 1 and Index maintains
first duplicate element.
ParkingLot

Arrays -
SortOneArrayUsingAnother
chunks will use intermediary arraylist
Remove Element by index
TripletThatSumToGivenValue

Fixed -
When it says, find something for "each" subArray. We need a collection. Ex - deque, list.
Use StringBuilder in countOccurrences

Variable -
Unique and Non-repeating - use map and use map.size() as condition

SortHashMap -> do not use stream(), use Collections.sort() or list.sort()
Merge the overlapping intervals of an array and return a new output array.

For level of testing -
Cyclomatic complexity = (No of edges - no of nodes)+2
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cyclomatic-complexity/
Statements in a program are represented as nodes, and control paths from one statement to
another are represented by Edges.
If the CC <=15 – Basic sanity test
If the CC is between 16 and 30 – Length Testing
If the CC is between 31 and 50 – Breadth testing
If the CC >50 – It’s a chaotic functionality and needs further decomposition

Comparator interface does not allowed static compare method so you always need object of class.

How do you deal with scalability issues?
1. Use horizontal scaling: Horizontal scaling means adding more instances of the application,
    rather than just increasing the resources of a single instance.
2. Use caching and content delivery networks (CDNs): Caching frequently accessed data and using
    CDNs to distribute static content can help to reduce the load on the application servers and
    improve performance for users.
3. Optimize database performance: Consider using database sharding, which distributes data across
    multiple servers, or using a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
4. Use asynchronous processing
5. Monitor and analyze performance
6. Design for scalability

What is the best solution to figure out the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped
without breaking it?
Use binary search tree. Find mid floor and drop it.
If it breaks, you move to mid of current and lowest floor.
If it does not break, move to mid of current and highest floor. Repeat.

How many children are born daily? -
US population: 320M
Life expectation: 80y
HP: Population equally spread for every age -> 0-1 years old: 320M/80 = 4M
Baby born in a day: 4M/365 = 11k

How many rounds would it take to choose the winner among the 25 teams in a single-elimination tournament?
N-1 rounds

For stack implemented by Deque -
push() is same as addFirst()
pop() is same as removeFirst()

Reflection in Automation -
Automation -
1. Keyword driven
2. PageFactory.initElements(driver, Form.class);
Second argument is of type Class.
Also,
Class abc = Class.forName("ABC");

We cannot overload two methods in Java if they differ only by static keyword

public interface WebDriver extends SearchContext {..}
public interface SearchContext {
    List<WebElement> findElements(By by);
    WebElement findElement(By by);
}

How will you survive on a desert isle while waiting for rescue?
Find a source of drinking water.
Find/build a shelter.
Build a fire.
Create rescue signals.
Find a source of food.
Create tools for catching food.
Fashion weapons for self defense.
Create a raft to leave the island.

Thread Safety -
A piece of code is thread-safe if it functions correctly during simultaneous execution by multiple threads.”
It must satisfy the need for multiple threads to access the same shared data and the need for a
shared piece of data to be accessed by only one thread at any given time.
