How to overload -
The number of parameters in two methods.
The data types of the parameters of methods.
The Order of the parameters of methods.

Rules -
1. We cannot overload two methods in Java if they differ only by static keyword
2. The first rule to overload a method in Java is to change the method signature.
3. The return type of method is not part of the method signature, so just changing
the return type will not overload a method in Java.  In fact, just changing the
return type will result in a compile-time error.
4. We can overload main(). But JVM calls main() method which receives string array
as arguments only.
5. Method Overloading and Type Promotion - One type is promoted to another implicitly
if no matching datatype is found.
