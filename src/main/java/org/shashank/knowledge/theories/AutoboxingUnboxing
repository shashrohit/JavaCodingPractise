Autoboxing refers to the conversion of a primitive value into an object of the
corresponding wrapper class. For example, converting int to Integer class.

The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is:
1 - Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class.
2 - Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class.

// Autoboxing of character
Character gfg = 'a';

Unboxing refers to converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding
primitive value. For example conversion of Integer to int.

The Java compiler applies to unbox when an object of a wrapper class is:
1 - Passed as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding primitive type.
2 - Assigned to a variable of the corresponding primitive type.

Integer i = new Integer(10);
// Unboxing the Object
int i1 = i;
