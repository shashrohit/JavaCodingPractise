Convert list of Integer to int array as -
list.toArray(new Integer[0]); returns Integer[] not int[]
list.stream().mapToInt(a -> a).toArray();

Converting int array to List of Integers
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 15, 40, 50, 50, 70};
List<Integer> output = Arrays.stream(arr)
        .filter(a -> a%2==0) // optional
        .boxed()
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

get str[0] as String -
str.substring(0, 1)

convert list<String> to String[] -
list.toArray(new String[0])

Joining list into a string -
StringUtils.join(outputList, " ") -> join(Collection var0, String var1)
OR
strbuilderobj.append(entry.getKey()).append(" ")

Character.isAlphabetic(char)

StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(" ");
for(String word: words) joiner.add(word);
   return joiner.toString();

Comparators OR Lambdas can be replaced as -
al.sort((a,b)-> a.compareTo(b));
Or
al.sort(String::compareTo);

Arrays.sort(arr) -> when objects implement comparable OR PRIMITIVE types (Not wrapper)
Arrays.sort(arr, Comparator)
Collections.sort(collection) -> when objects implements comparable OR PRIMITIVE types (Not wrapper)
Collections.sort(collection, Comparator)
list.sort(Comparator)

Comparator.reverseOrder()

1)	StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call
the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.	StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e.
not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
2)	StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(new String("Shashank");

append(char)
append(string)
charAt(int)
deleteCharAt()
insert(int, string)
indexOf(string)
toString()

Synchronised is used as a lock. As soon as thread enters a synchronized block,
it takes a lock and other threads trying to enter the same block are put to sleep.
Also any changes made are saved directly in memory (not in cache).

Volatile gives only the visibility feature of synchronised. Any changes made are made
to main memory. Volatile variables are never cached.

Transient variables are not serialized, instead their default value is saved.
Use -
Security - do not serialize passwords
Redundant - values that can be calculated by other means Ex - age using DOB.

Note - Transient must not be used with static or final as its ignored.

Car c = new Vehicle();
Not allowed -> sub class type variable cannot reference superclass object

Only public and protected members are inherited. Private members are not inherited.
Default members are inherited only if both classes are in the same package.
Constructors are not inherited.

A utility class consists of only static members and a private constructor. Hence it
cannot be instantiated.

SLF4J - The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) serves as a simple facade or abstraction
for various logging frameworks (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to
plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time. It is not itself a logging library,
but a generic interface to one of many logging libraries.

Log4j 1.2 - Welcome to Apache log4j, a logging library for Java.
Logback - Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project, picking up where log4j leaves off.
Log4j 2 - Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor.
