/*
The scope of a nested class is bounded by the scope of its enclosing class.
NestedClass does not exist independently of class OuterClass.

A nested class has access to the members, including private members, of the outer class.
But the enclosing class does not have access to the members of the nested class.

A nested class is also a member of its enclosing class.
A nested class can be declared private, public, protected, or package private(default).

Types of Nested classes -
1. static nested class
2. inner class - local and anonymous classes

Normal/Regular inner class	Vs Static nested class
1.	Without an outer class object existing, there cannot be an inner class object.
That is, the inner class object is always associated with the outer class object.
But without an outer class object existing, there may be a static nested class object.
2.	Inside normal/regular inner class, static members canâ€™t be declared.
Inside static nested class, static members can be declared.
4.	Inside normal/regular inner class, Both static and non-static members of outer class
can be accessed directly. Inside static nested class, only a static member of outer class
can be accessed directly.
